# Globe Trotter

This is a physics simulation that I programmed for an internship at the Mars Institute Global Internship Research Program (MI-GRIP).

The simulation was a supplement to the paper that I wrote on my work on the Globe Trotter as a first author. The paper was accepted for publication by the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group's (LEAG) 2023 Annual Meeting, which supports NASA in lunar exploration.

## How to Use

Bounce_Graph.py is a graphical representation of a the bouncing ball in the gravity of Earth, Moon, and Mars.

Bounce_Pit.py is the actual simulation, make sure that the "images" folder is in the same folder as Bounce_Pit.py when you run it!!!
